This is a program that connects to a SQLite database that I built for school. After creating a connection to the database, it creates a cursor to execute SQL statements. Then it creates an empty table called contacts with 5 fields (ContactID, FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber, and EmailAddress) and adds values for 5 records into the table. Then it commits the current changes. After that it selects all from table contacts and saves them to a list which is then printed using a for loop. There are some more select statements that do a few different things such as selecting specific fields in the table, updating a contact's email and phone fields whose ID is 4, and deletes the last contact that was entered whose ID is 5. After printing the results of those statements it commits the changes and then closes the connection to the database.
